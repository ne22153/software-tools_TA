# Web Scraping

[lecture slides](./slides.md)

So far in this unit we've mostly taught you how to construct web pages. However,
another useful skill is being able to automatically access web pages and mine
their content. This week, that will be our focus, both using existing tools and
by writing our own scraping code.


## Pre-reading

Please watch [this introductory
video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/9ceda4de-3749-4d9e-ad2c-3def7cd0c7d0)
([slides](./Scraping.pdf)) before the lab. As with all weeks, it can also be a
good idea to look at the exercises below before the start of the lab itself.


## Exercises

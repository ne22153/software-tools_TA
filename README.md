# Software Tools

Unit materials for the _Software Tools_ unit (COMS10012 and COMSM0085).

Learning in this unit is structured around hands-on exercises in the weekly lab
session.  To support you in this, we give lectures and provide pre-reading that
introduces you to the tools or technologies you’ll be working with in each
week’s lab session.  You are also able to see the workshop exercises ahead of
the session – this is intentional, as it's usually a good idea to look at and
attempt exercises ahead of the lab. The schedule below links to each week's
content.

## Assessment 

Assessment for this unit consists of two components, both of which are 1-hour
paper-based multiple-choice tests, covering everything taught in the
corresponding TB, and worth 50% of the mark for this unit.  The tests are
open-book, meaning you can bring unlimited paper-based notes with you (but no
electronic assistance).

 - The TB1 test will be held in Week 12 (2024-12-06) at 14:00. An entry should
   already be in your timetable. The test will cover everything taught in TB1.
 - The TB2 test will be held in the summer exam period, and will be scheduled
   closer to the time by the university's exam timetabling department. The test
will cover everything taught in TB2.

### Example papers

The following papers and solutions show you examples of the sorts of questions
you may be asked in the exam, and what the correct selections are. Be warned
that studying only these questions is a great way to end up surprised and
underprepared for the real exam.

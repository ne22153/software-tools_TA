# HTML

[lecture slides](./slides.md) 

HTML5, officially introduced in 2014, is the markup language used for writing
modern web documents. It gets rid of a lot of historical annoyances and
inconsistencies from previous versions of HTML and XML and contains a lot of new
standard tags and attributes for features that individual sites had built with
JavaScript or Adobe Flash in the past. For example, HTML5 has a `<video>` tag
for a consistent way to include videos that work across different platforms and
without plug-ins, and a standard way of writing a date picker or "calendar"
widget. 

## Pre-reading

Please both watch the short introduction videos below and read the linked
resources from the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), which we'll be using as a
reference for much of the web development portion of this unit.

### MDN reading

These pages are pitched at a lower level of technical expertise than CS
students, so you should get through them very quickly. Many of them also contain
interactive examples to try out. If your future career involves web development,
you will be consulting documentation like the [MDN HTML reference
guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) a lot - for example,
to read through all the attributes you can put on a [form
tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form). For now we
want you to read the following:

  - [MDN: Getting Started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started) The very basics, and the HTML5 page template. 
  - [MDN: HTML Text Fundamentals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals) A recap of paragraphs, headings, styling, semantic tags.
  - [MDN: Creating Hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks) All about the `<a>` tag.
  - [MDN: Document and website structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure) HTML5 semantic tags for structure.
  - [MDN: HTML5 input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types) More on using the most appropriate controls in your forms.

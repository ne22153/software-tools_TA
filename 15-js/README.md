# JavaScript

[slides](./slides.md)

JavaScript is a programming language supported by many web browsers as a
scripting language that allows you to programmatically control dynamic behaviour
within a webpage. Many websites rely on JavaScript to enrich pages and provide
complex functionality to end-users.
